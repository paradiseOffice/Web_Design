      <h2>About Kirk Hallam</h2>
      <p>Kirk Hallam is a village located in between Derby and Nottingham. There are about 6 thousand people living here, and the nearest town is Ilkeston, to the north. Other nearby villages include West Hallam. There are two pubs, the Bull's head and the Castle. Kirk Hallam grew in the 1950's as workers from Stanton on Quarry Hill Road needed somewhere to live. To read more about Stanton works, <a href="#">go here.</a>
      </p><p>The lake itself is situated in between two secondary schools, Kirk Hallam College and St John Haughton's. St John Haughton's is the catholic school. There are two other primary schools and a shopping area in Kirk Hallam. The shopping area has a chemist, dentist, small post office and a Nisa extra. The petrol station is a co-op and is pretty expensive except for fruit and veg. People in Kirk Hallam often go shopping to the Ilkeston market on Thursday and Saturday - as Ilkeston has much more variety in the way of food shopping. There are two different bus routes to Ilkeston and one going to Nottingham. You can also easily get to Derby from Kirk Hallam, with buses every 15 minutes except on bank holidays or Sunday. </p><p>The social club near Dallimore primary school now hosts youth clubs and other activities for the people of Kirk Hallam. There are also activities for younger and older people held at the community hall, around the corner from the chemist and shops. A Sure Start centre is also next door to the community hall. There is another lake right on the other side of Kirk Hallam, near the allotments. Pioneer meadows is also equipped for night fishing. Angling is also allowed on Kirk Hallam lake, but the fish have to be thrown back as there aren't that many fish in the lake currently.
      </p><p>If you don't like fishing there are plenty of places to walk or cycle, including West Hallam, the Nutbrook trail or walking to the bowling alley on Derby road. There is also the Rutland recreation park, in Ilkeston and a library. There is a church in Kirk Hallam, the <a href="#">All Saints Church</a>. All Saints is on the main road, sort of in the middle of Kirk Hallam. They hold numerous Christmas and Easter celebrations. </p>
